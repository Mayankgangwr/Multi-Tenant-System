# 🏗️ Multi-Tenant System

A robust and scalable **multi-tenant backend system** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**. This system supports secure tenant-based data isolation, role-based access, Redis integration, and authentication workflows for SaaS-style platforms.

**GitHub**: [Mayankgangwr/Multi-Tenant-System](https://github.com/Mayankgangwr/Multi-Tenant-System)

---

## 📌 Purpose

This system is designed to:

- Allow multiple organizations (tenants) to operate on the same platform with isolated data.
- Provide `Admin` and `Subadmin` roles with different levels of access.
- Ensure secure API access via JWT tokens.
- Integrate Redis caching for performance and scalability.
- Use TypeScript for better structure and type safety.

## 📂 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayankgangwr/Multi-Tenant-System.git
cd Multi-Tenant-System
````

---

## 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all `dependencies` and `devDependencies` listed in `package.json`.

---

## 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Here's an example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your values to the `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/multiTenantDB
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

---

## 🏁 Run the Project

### Development (auto-reload using ts-node + nodemon):

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production (after compiling TypeScript):

```bash
npm start
```

You must compile TypeScript first:

```bash
tsc
```

## 🧪 Available Scripts

| Script        | Description                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the server in development mode using `ts-node` & `nodemon` |
| `npm start`   | Starts the server from `dist/index.js` (compiled JS)              |
| `npm test`    | Placeholder for tests (currently not implemented)                 |

## 🌍 API Design (Planned)

* `POST /auth/register` – Tenant/user registration
* `POST /auth/login` – JWT-based authentication
* `GET /tenants` – Admin route to fetch all tenants
* `GET /profile` – Subadmin profile endpoint

> ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI integration planned for documenting all routes.

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements

* Swagger API Docs
* Docker support
* CI/CD via GitHub Actions
* Rate limiting
* Test coverage with Jest
